# NYCOpenData-311-Rats-and-Restaurant-Grades
A Machine Learning Engineering notebook wherein I deal with a 16GB data set and predict what features leads to resolution time for 311 calls. I also examine the relationship between NYC rat sighting and low restaurant grades. Lots of pretty visualizations and Machine Learning techniques!
